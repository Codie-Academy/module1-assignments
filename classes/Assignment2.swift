//
// Create a subclass of the "Car" class called "ElectricCar" that adds a property for battery life in miles. 
// Include a method that calculates the cost to fully charge the battery based on the cost per kilowatt-hour. 
// Create an object of this subclass and print out its information and the cost to charge its battery.
// This would output "White 2022 Tesla Model S" to the console, as well as "The cost to fully charge the battery is $0.36." assuming a cost of $0.12 per kilowatt-hour.
